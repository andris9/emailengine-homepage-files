## Almost Perfect Deliverability

EmailEngine utilizes the user's own email servers to [send emails](https://docs.emailengine.app/using-as-a-transactional-email-service/), giving the appearance to the recipient that the email was sent directly from the user, rather than through a third-party service, resulting in near-perfect deliverability.

## Built-in OAuth2 Proxy for IMAP and SMTP

Bridge the gap between traditional IMAP and SMTP clients and modern OAuth2-enabled email accounts with EmailEngine. Clients can effortlessly authenticate using their standard passwords, while EmailEngine [takes care of the OAuth2 connection](https://docs.emailengine.app/proxying-oauth2-imap-connections-for-outlook-and-gmail/) in the background, ensuring a smooth relay of commands from the client to the server.

## Convenient Hosted Authentication

Streamline the authentication process for your users with EmailEngine's [hosted authentication](https://emailengine.app/hosted-authentication) form. Once the email account is authorized, the user will be redirected back to your app.\
\
While you can still register accounts through [API calls](https://api.emailengine.app/#operation/postV1Account), hosted authentication provides a more user-friendly and easier setup option during development.

## Quickstart

EmailEngine is a self-hosted email automation platform that offers easy access to email accounts through a user-friendly HTTP REST API for receiving and sending emails. The platform actively monitors these accounts and sends webhook notifications for any updates.

Here's how to get started:

1. Check out the installation instructions for your system [here](https://emailengine.app/set-up).
2. Launch EmailEngine from the command line:

```
$ emailengine --dbs.redis="redis://127.0.0.1:6379"
```

3. Open <http://127.0.0.1:3000> in your browser and activate a free 14-day trial.
4. Generate an access token and head over to the API Reference page to test out some API calls.

## FAQ

### Who is EmailEngine intended for?

EmailEngine is ideal for anyone looking to integrate their system with existing email accounts. For instance, a help desk service that operates through the <support@domain.tld> account and converts incoming emails into support tickets.

### How does EmailEngine function?

EmailEngine maintains an open connection to each registered email account and continuously listens for any changes. When you make a request through the API, EmailEngine converts it into the corresponding mail server command to execute the desired action.

### Is a license key required?

You can start a free 14-day trial directly from the dashboard without the need for a license key. Once the trial license expires, EmailEngine will stop processing email accounts until a valid commercial license is obtained.

### Do I need to purchase multiple license keys?

Typically, no. You would pay for a [yearly subscription](https://postalsys.com/plans) to Postal Systems, not for multiple license keys for EmailEngine software. If your subscription is active, you can generate as many license keys as needed at no extra cost.

### What are the system requirements for EmailEngine?

EmailEngine requires [Redis](https://redis.io/) as its caching database. As long as you have a reasonably recent version of Redis installed, you should be good to go. For optimal performance, it's recommended to keep the latency between Redis and EmailEngine as low as possible.

### What protocols does EmailEngine support?

[EmailEngine primarily uses IMAP](/supported-account-types) to access email accounts and SMTP to send emails. It also supports the Gmail API and MS Graph API for accessing and sending emails. Other protocols, such as POP3, ActiveSync, or the Exchange Web Services (EWS) SOAP API, are not supported.

### What are the data compliance considerations with EmailEngine?

As a self-hosted solution, EmailEngine does not send or store any data outside of your network. It only retains [minimal metadata](https://docs.emailengine.app/data-compliance/) necessary for syncing and caching, but not the actual contents of the emails. This ensures that all data remains securely within your network.

### Is it possible to run multiple EmailEngine instances with shared Redis database?

Currently, this is not supported. Horizontal scaling is on the development roadmap, but there is no estimated time of arrival for this feature at this time.

### Why am I receiving a lot of 504 errors for API calls?

IMAP is a single-threaded protocol, meaning that only one command can be executed at a time per account, and you must wait for it to finish before issuing another command. If multiple API requests are made against a single account simultaneously, EmailEngine will queue these requests and process them one at a time. If a queued command cannot be processed within 10 seconds, EmailEngine will abort it with a 504 response.\
\
To resolve this, you have two options: either avoid sending multiple requests at the same time, or increase the 10-second limit. The "Max command duration" option can be found in the configuration options, as documented [here](https://emailengine.app/configuration#general).

### Is EmailEngine similar to Nylas Universal Email API?

For a detailed comparison, you can refer to the comparison article [here](https://docs.emailengine.app/emailengine-vs-nylas/). In brief, while both may seem alike, they are in fact, significantly different.

### I have a different question not answered here.

If you have a question that hasn't been answered, you can reach out for help in the EmailEngine's support [channels](https://emailengine.app/support).
